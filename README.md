# Taj's Core Framework

## How to use

Currently available docs are outdated and possibly will stay that way, until all the Core features are added and complete (which is never lol?)
Website Docs: <https://tajsmods.github.io/docs/core/main/> (Possibly worst source of information, these are there mostly as a placeholder)
Deepwiki: <https://deepwiki.com/TajsMods/Core> (Can be updated every 7 days)
